# GitHub Actions Workflow Examples

This repository is dedicated to learning and experimenting with **GitHub Actions** by writing workflows in **YAML**.  
The goal is to understand how automation works in GitHub and how we can use workflows for CI/CD, testing, and deployment.

## 📖 What is GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) platform that allows you to:
- Automate tasks directly in your GitHub repository.
- Run workflows triggered by events (like `push`, `pull_request`, or scheduled jobs).
- Build, test, and deploy applications seamlessly.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

### Explanation
- **`.github/workflows/`** → This is the special folder where all GitHub Actions workflow files (`.yml`) live.
- **`print.yml`** → A beginner-friendly workflow that prints messages to the console.
- **`build.yml`** → A workflow for compiling and testing your project (e.g., Java, Spring Boot).
- **`deploy.yml`** → Reserved for deployment automation (e.g., Docker, Ansible, AWS/Azure).
- **`README.md`** → The documentation file that explains the purpose of the repo.
